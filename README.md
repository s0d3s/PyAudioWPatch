# PyAudioWPatch

This fork will allow you to use the WASAPI device as loopback using **PyAudio**.
<br>
So you can *use speakers to record audio*âœ¨

## For whom?

If you want to record sound from speakers in python, then this fork is for you.

> PyAudioW(*indows|ASAPI*)Patch come only with WMME, DirectX and WASAPI support
> if you need more -> create an issue

## How

The Windows Audio Session API ([WASAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi)) allows you to use output devices (that support this API) in loopback mode. At the time of release, it was impossible to achieve this using the original version of PyAudio.

> Note: Now WASAPI loopback devices are duplicated at the end of the list as virtual devices. That is, to record from speakers, you need to use not just a WASAPI device, but its loopback analogue. All loopback devices are **input devices**.

## How to use

*Read -> Install -> Enjoy!*

### Installation

```bash
pip install PyAudioWPatch
```
> Wheels are available for **Windows**, Python *3.{7,8,9,10,11}*.<br />
> All wheels support APIs: WMME, WASAPI, DirectX(DSound).

### In code

With new features:

```python
import pyaudiowpatch as pyaudio

with pyaudio.PyAudio() as p:
    # Open PyA manager via context manager
    with p.open(...) as stream:
        # Open audio stream via context manager
        # Do some stuff
        ...
```

Or in original PyAudio way:

```python
import pyaudiowpatch as pyaudio

p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = p.open(...)

# Do some stuff
...

stream.stop_stream()
stream.close()

# close PyAudio
p.terminate()
```

### Difference with PyAudio

 - The behavior of all standard methods is unchanged
 - Added several *life-improving* methods
 - Fixed problem with name encoding
 - Ability to record audio from WASAPI loopback devices (see [example](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/examples/pawp_record_wasapi_loopback.py))
 
#### More detailed
 - new methods:
   - [`get_host_api_info_generator`](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1082) - Iterate over all Host APIs
   - [`get_device_info_generator`](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1096) - Iterate over all devices
   - [`get_device_info_generator_by_host_api`](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1109) - Iterate over all devices, by specific Host API(index/type)
   - [`get_loopback_device_info_generator`](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1133) - Iterate over all devices(with loopback mode)
   - [`print_detailed_system_info`](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1149) - Print some info about Host Api and devices
<!---
   - [`get_host_api_info_generator`](src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1066) - Iterate over all Host APIs
   - [`get_device_info_generator`](src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1080) - Iterate over all devices
   - [`get_device_info_generator_by_host_api`](src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1093) - Iterate over all devices, by specific Host API(index/type)
   - [`get_loopback_device_info_generator`](src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1117) - Iterate over all devices(with loopback mode)
   - [`print_detailed_system_info`](src/pyaudiowpatch/__init__.py#L1133) - Print some info about Host Api and devices-->
 
 - new features:
   - Context manager support, for PyAudio(manager) and Stream classes
   - Run `python -m pyaudiowpatch` to get list of devices(like `print_detailed_system_info` call)
 
#### Examples:
 - [Play sine, using \'new context manager'](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/blob/master/examples/pawp_play_sine_using_context_manger.py)

## Sources

The following were taken as a basis:

 - PortAudio v19 \[[8b6d16f26ad660e68a97743842ac29b939f3c0c1](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio/commit/8b6d16f26ad660e68a97743842ac29b939f3c0c1)]
 - PyAudio v0.2.12
 
## How to build manually

 - Build PortAudio (using the instructions in the [README](portaudio_v19/README.md))
 - ~~Install [~~python~~](https://www.python.org/downloads/)~~
 - run in the PyAudioWPatch directory:
   ```bush
   python setup.py install
   ```
 - ???
 - Profit.
 
 Also you can build wheel**s**:
 - `pip install cibuildwheel`
 - Run in Cygwin:
    ```bash
    ./cygwin_cibuildwheel_build.sh
    ```
 - Get your wheels in the `./wheelhouse` folder

## PyAudio

PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio v19, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.

PyAudio is distributed under the MIT License.

* [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAudio)

## Installation

See the INSTALLATION file in the source distribution for details. In summary, install PyAudio using `pip` on most platforms.

### Windows

```sh
python -m pip install pyaudio
```

This installs the precompiled PyAudio library with PortAudio v19 19.7.0 included. The library is compiled with support for Windows MME API, DirectSound, WASAPI, and WDM-KS. It does not include support for ASIO. If you require support for APIs not included, you will need to compile PortAudio and PyAudio.

### macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the prerequisite [portaudio](http://portaudio.com) library, then install PyAudio using `pip`:

```sh
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```

### GNU/Linux

Use the package manager to install PyAudio. For example, on Debian-based systems:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

Alternatively, if the latest version of PyAudio is not available, install it using `pip`. Be sure to first install development libraries for `portaudio19` and `python3`.

### Building from source

See the INSTALLATION file.

## Documentation & Usage Examples

* Read the [API Documentation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/), or generate it from the source using [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

* Usage examples are in the `examples` directory of the source distribution, or see the [project homepage](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).
